### Extension Install

Anyone can create an extension by following the [example extension](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/tree/extension_install_02/lnbits/extensions/example).

Extensions can be installed by an admin user after the **LNbits** instance has been started.

Go to `Manage Server` > `Server` > `Extensions Manifests`

An `Extension Manifest` is an link to a `JSON` file whitch contains information about various extensions that can be installed (repository of extensions).
Multiple repositories can be configured.


**LNbits** administrators should configure their instances to use repositories that they trust (like the [lnbits-extensions](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-extensions/) one.
